Hyperion is a high-performance generative art tool built in Godot for exploring and recording complex 4D fractals, including Mandelbox and Menger variations.

🚀 Features
Dual Fractal Engines: Seamlessly switch between Mandelbox and Menger4D architectures.

Deep 4D Controls: Manipulate the W-slice, rotation, and hollowing parameters in real-time.

Advanced Symmetry: Toggle folding and symmetry across X, Y, and Z axes with custom strength sliders.

Mirrored Panorama Backgrounds: Upload any image to create a seamless, horizontally mirrored 3D sky environment.

Cinematic Animation System: Set waypoints to record smooth, multi-segment flythroughs.

High-Fidelity Recording: Frame-locked 30 FPS PNG sequence export for perfectly smooth video production.

⌨️ Controls & Hotkeys
W/A/S/D + Mouse: Fly through the fractal.

H: Toggle UI visibility for a clean view.

R: Stop recording (saves currently captured frames to user://recordings).

F2: Toggle Debug Tools.

📸 Recording & Export
To ensure the highest quality, Hyperion captures a sequence of PNG frames.

Set your waypoints and test your path.

Press Play Animation.

Press Start Recording.

Once finished, press R to stop.

Hyperion will prompt you to save the final video; ensure you have FFmpeg installed on your system path for the automatic stitcher to work.

You must have FFMPG installed to save animations https://www.ffmpeg.org/www.ffmpeg.org/ 

For program to save as mp4 you must add FFMPEG to system path. You only have to do this step one time.  Instructions are here. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bv4__JFZX7mvYdIsItGDAiIU2nbfe3P5ZYgVwHXHJXg/edit?usp=sharing
